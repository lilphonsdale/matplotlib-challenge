Pandas Challange

<h1>Description</h1>
Analyzing the results of a clinic study of various drug regimens on tumor size in mice.

Two data sets are merged and then a duplicate record is identified and removed.

The merged dataset is grouped in order to produce a summary statistics table which describes the tumor volume for reach drug regimen.

Some visualizations are produced:
  A bar chart showing the number of timepoints measured for mice in each drug regimen
  A pie chart showing the distribution of male and female mice in the study
  A box and whisker plot looks at the tumor volume at the end of the drug regimen for 4 drugs of interest
  A line plot looks at the experience of one individual mouse in one specific drug regimen
  A scatter plot looks at the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume
  
The relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume is further investiagted for correlation and a regression line is applied to the scatterplot.
